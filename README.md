## üå± A little about me:
<div align="justify">
  My background has always been in IT; I started off in Support and Administration but as the years have gone by, my interest in building apps and websites has grown and I have developed a want to learn and create my own. This lead me to go to take part in, and complete, a bootcamp in Web Development where I learnt how to code, learning the basics in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
  
  I am Currently studying at the Open University, working towards completing my degree in 'Computing and IT (Software)' which is a software engineering course. However, I am also working on bringing my skillset up-to-date and studying, through Coursera, the "Meta Front-End Developer" professional certificate at the moment.
  
  With interest in also expanding my knowledge and abilities in data science and machine learning in the coming weeks/months. I have a keen interest in developing solutions that will leverage AI to solve real-world problems, and would love to get involved in some projects that would advance my skills in these areas. 
    
  I‚Äôm currently working on a few personal projects for my close friends, where I can build my portfolio and skills in the areas I've previously mentioned, I would be happy to share these once the first iteration is complete, but feel like until then I would like to keep them private as they are all "under inital construction".
    
  I have also recently gone through a lot of serious life changes, from quitting smoking, joining a gym and going regularly, to taking part in charity events, such as Macmillan's "100 push-up a day in April" and raising funds for the Little Princess Trust, where I shall be shaving my head and donating my hair to help create a wig for those affected by cancer and other conditions that has caused them to lose their hair, I've started eating healthier and trying to improve my health as the charities I am trying to help have made me realise I need to do better in my own life to be able to help others.
